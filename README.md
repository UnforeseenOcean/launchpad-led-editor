# launchpad-led-editor
C# application to make beautiful LED creations with the NOVATION LAUNCHPAD.

It is actually under really early construction!
Current features:  
+ Opening/Closing MIDI Devices
+ Testing sequence
+ Paint LEDs (click on them to color them)
+ Color selection
+ Ability to scroll text (with variable speed, color, and loop)

This was made with love and the following help from:  
+ http://code.google.com/p/midi-dot-net/ - The unofficial C# MIDI library to make things easier.
+ https://github.com/jstnryan/midi-dot-net - A fork from midi-dot-net, with SysEx features (needed for Text Scroll)

If you have any suggestions, ideas, or something, just tell me under iredcraft@gmail.com
